A new exciting year ahead!

In January, our very magic BeCode team gathered to celebrate almost 3 years of providing a new type of education, helping people from all backgrounds, genders and horizons get closer to employment. It was also the opportunity for us all to look ahead and formulate our objectives for 2020 : 
 
- Offering a training to more than 550 juniors by the end of the year. 

- Diversifying our offer by launching new types of training.

- Launching a reskilling programme for employees.

- Strenghtening our mission by further expanding our audience, giving a learning opportunity to more people with some form of labor handicap.
