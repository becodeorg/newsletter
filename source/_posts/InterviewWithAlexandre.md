**Tom Crohin, Communications & Marketing Officer :** Today, we are meeting one of BeCode’s very first recruits, our very own Head of Pedagogy, Alexandre! Hi Alex', how are you?

**Alexandre Plennevaux, Head of Pedagogy :** I’m doing good. Covid-19 is shaking the planet, and me too. But next to all the negative aspects of it, I think there’s also a positive side. In a way, this situation allows us to speak to more different people, but it also adds distance and nothing will replace a coffee-break conversation. I really miss this part. But I think that BeCode, as a spaceship, is adapting very well to this. I am amazed by the adaptation capacity of a 35-collaborators team living around the country, who are able to align properly and find opportunities in problems. Things are also going well with learners : everyone was happy to start or resume their training. 

**Tom :** You often say that “problems” should be seen as an opportunity of learning. The situation we have been through these past months has never been seen before and comes with a lot of obstacles to tackle. To you, what are the biggest challenges and opportunities for BeCode in this crisis?

**Alexandre :** Core values at BeCode are team spirit, group dynamic, mutual help and solidarity. How can we create group dynamics remotely, only interacting through a screen? That was one of our biggest concerns. But things are going well. We have switched to a new communication platform, Discord, to better stay in touch with our learners. Discord allows us to share screens, communicate orally, create small groups, etc.. It really eased the person-to-person communication. 

We have also reinforced and created new rituals to be had on all campuses. We have the weekly challenges, a digital stand-up meeting where each earner identifies their challenges for the week and shares them with the group, as well as a debrief on those objectives, for those who want or need to share how they feel.

We also have daily rituals, such as the morning call during which the coaches start the day and describe the day’s activities, the technical watch where one learner picks a hot digital-related topic and presents it to the group. Our coaches also have as many one-on-one conversations with the learners to make sure we stay in touch, to get to know them, and to keep the trust. 

Some campuses also have their rituals, like “changing tables” everyday : the learners work in different groups so they work on their soft skills and get to know their colleagues more. Some coaches share their music channels and the learners can find out about the different music styles our coaches like.

**Tom :** As we speak, the trainings are taking place in a full remote way, but the idea in the coming weeks and months is to implement a blended model. Can you tell us about this new way of learning?

**Alexandre :** The blended model consists in learning both from home and in our campuses, which is very close to the way companies are working. With the confinement, many businesses discovered teleworking, which has now prove its worth. Businesses are probably going to shift to a much more blended world and, in some cases, like in the IT sector, work remotely only. 

This means that our learners will work on individual exercises when at home, and have group assignments when at the campus, or special focus that fits their learning needs. Some learners also do not have very good working conditions at home. That is a very important element to take into account for us. 

We have equipped each campus with facemasks, soap and hydroalcoholic gel and social distancing will be applied for the safety of our staff and learners.

**Tom :** I think we are all longing to get back to a more normal life, where we can enjoy a meal in a restaurant or attend a concert. But I also think some aspects of our coping with the crisis will remain part of a “new normal” for us all. According to you, what will remain from this exceptional situation at BeCode? 

**Alexandre :** First of all, we have realized that this is all possible. That is the first thing that we’ll take away from this situation. Remote learning, which we always have liked at BeCode, will probably be part of the training on the long run. The flexibility we all need is also a muscle that will remain. At BeCode, it’s not “Do or die”, it’s “Bend or die”. 

A coach told me the other day: “As a coach, we receive a lot of energy from the group each time a learner figures out how to solve a problem and is happy about it. It’s a dopamine boost for the group that we unfortunately cannot have with a 100% remote learning model.” That’s why I think we’ll implement it on the long run, but will never become an online training.

**Tom :** Even before you joined the BeCode team, you’ve always been very fond of self-learning. Do you have tips for those of us who struggle with working/learning new things by themselves in quarantine? 

**Alexandre :** I believe the most important is to set yourself an objective to reach. It can be anything you like as long as you enjoy doing it and you can do it by yourself. It can be a personal project, addressing a problem or even something creative or artistic. 

For example, I personally love inspiring quotes, and i’ve always struggled to find a website where I could save the ones I find. So I decided to create a website for this. Each time I want to learn a new technology, I implement it on my website. It really is my playground. 

I think it’s also extremely important to dare to seek help when you feel you don’t understand something. Because that will happen. 

**Tom :** Digital transformation is a source of concern for a lot of people. With this current crisis, this fear is likely to grow stronger, as we have realized how technology can help in our everyday life. For example, a bar in Spain has replaced its waiters by robots to avoid physical contact. What would you say to reassure people who fear for their jobs or their lifestyle?

**Alexandre :** First of all, I think this example that you gave, in Spain, is more about marketing than digital transformation. We have noticed that machines are a good complement to human work. For instance, I have see a news report on a furniture company that uses robots to sand tables and chairs. This work used to be operated by people. But they did not fire anyone. The people are now controlling the robots. That allowed the company to keep their human capital until more advanced ages without them suffering from tendonitis. 

Robots offer a productivity boost but do not replace people. They complement them. Of course, in some cases, people lose their job. But I think that most of the time, technology cannot work for long without human interaction. Since the beginning of times, technological evolutions have changed the way we work. 

And that’s why I believe BeCode is important and useful. We help people turn this evolution into a life opportunity. Once again, it’s all about lessons in flexibility. 

**Tom :** Thank you Alex'.
